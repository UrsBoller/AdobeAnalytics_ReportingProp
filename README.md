# Adobe Analytics Reporting 2.0
During the Adobe Summit EMEA 2019 in London I presented a new way to add a documentation direcly to workspace projects. You can read a blog post about my tip at [webanalyticsfordevelopers.com/2019/05/15/adobe-analytics-documentation-2-0/](https://webanalyticsfordevelopers.com/2019/05/15/adobe-analytics-documentation-2-0/)

In this github I uploaded the whole source code as well as additional information to make it as easy as possible.

## Source code for your Adobe Analytics Tag Manager
Either in "Adobe DTM" oder "Launch, by Adobe" you need to add code to the Adobe Analytics "Custom Code". Basically you add a new function "writeAADocuString" and call it from inside s.doPlugins. You're custom code should look something like this:
```
// Define function for documentation (see source code in github)
var writeAADocuString = function (s) { ... }

// Enable plugins
s.usePlugins = true;

function s_doPlugins(s) {
    // Do your custom stuff here

    // Call the quality stats function at the end!
    writeAADocuString(s);
}
// Set plugins function
s.doPlugins = s_doPlugins;
```

The code for the function "writeAADocuString" is in the [github-file "writeAADocuString.js"](https://github.com/UrsBoller/AdobeAnalytics_ReportingProp/blob/master/writeAADocuString.js)

## Excel file for Classification and Debugging
After you send your codes to Adobe Analytics by implementing the code above, you can classify the codes to add the real names of the items. To make it easier to create the classification file, you can use the file in this github:
[Excel file "20190511_DocuProp_KeyTemplate_v1.0.xlsx"](https://github.com/UrsBoller/AdobeAnalytics_ReportingProp/raw/master/20190511_DocuProp_KeyTemplate_v1.0.xlsx)the file has two sheets for the following purpose:
1) <strong>Sheet "DocuString"</strong> contains the table with all codes generated by the code above. This sheet can be used for your classification by adding the desired meta data to all codes. Download a classification file for your prop, copy the table and upload to Adobe Analytics.
2) <strong>Sheet "DecodeDocuString"</strong> lets you inspect the new string on the server call. just copy the full string from your Adobe Analytics server call to the marked field and see what codes have been collected. The table uses the classification sheet to lookup the friendly names of all codes.

## Please test before publishing (and Disclaimer)
I strongly recommend to test the code after you add it to your Analytics Tool and before you publish for the live website. Even if we tryed to keep the code as clean and fast as possible, there might be bad situation we haven't seen yet.
